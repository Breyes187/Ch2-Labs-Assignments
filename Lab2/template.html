        <p>Welcome to Wild Rescues. Our mission is to rescue, rehabilitate, and release wildlife back into their natural
        environment. We are a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping injured wildlife.</p>
        <p>Our staff provides around-the-clock care for wildlife in need. We also provide long-term care for wildlife that cannot be released
        back into their natural environment.</p>
        <p>Will you partner with us? We need caring volunteers to help care for our animals. You can also donate, become a member, or
          become a sponsor. Contact us today.</p>
